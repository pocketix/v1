		<h1>IoTiX Project Overview</h1>
		<p><strong>IoTiX</strong> is a block- and form-based visual programming language and editor currently being developed
			by <a href="mailto:ijohn@fit.vut.cz">Petr John</a> and <a href="mailto:hynek@fit.vut.cz">Jiří Hynek</a> at <a
					href="https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en" target="_blank">BUT FIT</a>, primarily aimed at automating smart devices
			on mobile phones.</p>

		<p>The first prototype was created through a collaboration between BUT FIT and <a href="https://www.logimic.com/cs/"
																						  target="_blank">Logimic</a> as part of
			the project <em>Services for Water Management and Monitoring Systems in Retention Basins</em>.</p>

		<p>More information is available on the <a href="https://github.com/pocketix" target="_blank">Pocketix GitHub
			Organization</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>IoTiX</strong> specifically refers to the current ecosystem of editors and interpreter built around the
			first version of the Pocketix scripting language.</p>

			<h2>IoTiX Editor (React & Angular)</h2>
			<p>The <a href="editor">IoTiX Editor</a>, available in React and Angular
				(pocketix-react and pocketixng respecively) versions, provides mobile interfaces for
				designing automation flows. These editors are ideal for non-programmers. Key features
				include block and form-based editing, configurable conditions and actions, device integration
				and workflow logic, and compatibility with the IoTiX scripting language.
			</p>

			<p>The visual editor is composed of several integrated components that collectively support both graphical and
				textual programming. At its core, the Program module manages synchronization between the text and visual
				editors while maintaining an undo history. The Text Editor enables direct user input and ensures real-time
				updates to the graphical view, whereas the Visual Editor facilitates intuitive visual programming through
				recursively nested blocks, commands, and expressions. To enhance adaptability, the system supports Dynamic
				Language Modification, allowing runtime changes to accommodate diverse device models. Finally, Input Validation
				ensures correctness through syntactic checks in the text editor and semantic validation in the graphical
				interface.
			</p>

			<h2>IoTiX Interpreter</h2>
			<p>The <a href="/interpreter">IoTiX Interpreter</a>, is built around two core interfaces, IReferenceManager and ICommander,
				which abstract system-specific details and enable integration with diverse environments, including those with
				custom digital twins or non-JavaScript runtimes. IReferenceManager manages loading and storing of device
				parameters, while ICommander handles the dispatching of execution commands. Program execution begins with the
				creation of a ProgramRunner, which parses the program into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and constructs a
				dependency table. Each block in the program can be evaluated and visually represented, ensuring alignment between
				graphical and textual logic. The evaluation process involves retrieving parameters, binding values, traversing the
				AST, and dispatching the resulting commands through the provided interfaces.
			</p>

			<p>Through this architecture, the IoTiX Interpreter provides a powerful backend for executing IoTiX scripts,
				enabling consistent and adaptable automation across smart environments.
