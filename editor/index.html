    <h1>IoTiX Editor Project Overview</h1>
    <p><strong>Pocketix</strong> is a block- and form-based visual programming language and editor currently being developed
        by <a href="mailto:ijohn@fit.vut.cz">Petr John</a> and <a href="mailto:hynek@fit.vut.cz">Jiří Hynek</a> at <a
                href="https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en" target="_blank">BUT FIT</a>, primarily aimed at automating smart devices
        on mobile phones.</p>

    <p>The first prototype was created through a collaboration between BUT FIT and <a href="https://www.logimic.com/cs/"
                                                                                      target="_blank">Logimic</a> as part of
        the project <em>Services for Water Management and Monitoring Systems in Retention Basins</em>.</p>

    <p>More information is available on the <a href="https://github.com/pocketix" target="_blank">Pocketix GitHub
        Organization</a>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>IoTiX Editor</strong>, available in React and Angular
        (pocketix-react and pocketixng respecively) versions, provides mobile interfaces for
        designing automation flows. These editors are ideal for non-programmers. Key features
        include block and form-based editing, configurable conditions and actions, device integration
        and workflow logic, and compatibility with the IoTiX scripting language.
    </p>

    <p>The visual editor is composed of several integrated components that collectively support both graphical and
         textual programming. At its core, the Program module manages synchronization between the text and visual
        editors while maintaining an undo history. The Text Editor enables direct user input and ensures real-time
        updates to the graphical view, whereas the Visual Editor facilitates intuitive visual programming through
        recursively nested blocks, commands, and expressions. To enhance adaptability, the system supports Dynamic
        Language Modification, allowing runtime changes to accommodate diverse device models. Finally, Input Validation
        ensures correctness through syntactic checks in the text editor and semantic validation in the graphical
        interface.

        <h3>Visual Editor Overview</h3>

        <p>The visual editor, an example of which is shown in the figure below, consists of the following platform
            components:</p>
        <div class="img-center">
            <img src="../img/visualEditorOverview.png" alt="Visual Editor Overview">
        </div>

        <h4>Program</h4>
        <p>The main graphical component that wraps the entire editor, including the graphical components of the text and
            visual editors. The component expects the program representation, language, and editor settings as input, with
            their current states maintained in memory. It also manages auxiliary objects, such as synchronization between
            the graphical and text editors, and a history stack allowing the user to undo actions. The component includes a
            configurable menu.</p>

        <h4>Text Editor</h4>
        <p>Provides text input (program) from the user. If synchronization is active, the parsed program representation is
            propagated to the Program component, and the visual editor’s content is updated accordingly.</p>

        <h4>Visual Editor</h4>
        <p>A graphical component intended for visual programming. Its principle is based on the recursive nesting of the
            following graphical components:</p>

        <h5>Block</h5>
        <p>A graphical component consisting of a sequence of compound or unit commands. It allows dynamic modification of
            the command list (moving, adding, removing). The list of commands is derived from the visual language definition
            and the device model.</p>

        <h5>Command</h5>
        <p>A generic graphical component representing a command, composed of a header and a body. Inputs are represented by
            visual and structural properties of the <span class="texttt">LanguageStatement</span> type. The header and body can be
            populated with other components using Angular’s Content Projection feature. This is specifically used in:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compound Command</strong>: A graphical component that adds an optional condition represented by an
                expression to the header, and a block of commands to the body.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Unit Command</strong>: A graphical component that extends the command body with a list of parameters
                represented by expressions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Expression</h5>
        <p>A graphical component represented by a field for writing expressions. A dialog for creating more complex
            expressions composed of variables (parameters) is also implemented. The principle of inserting parameters is
            demonstrated in the figure below.</p>
        <div class="img-center">
            <img src="../img/semanticErrorExample.png" alt="Expression Dialog">
        </div>

        <p>A timeout after finishing typing, followed by validation, is handled similarly to the text editor.</p>

        <h4>Dynamic Language Modification</h4>
        <p>The editor allows dynamic language modification during application runtime. For this purpose, a simple text
            editor, shown in the figure below, was created:</p>
        <div class="img-center">
            <img src="../img/simpleTextEditor.png" alt="Simple Text Editor">
        </div>

        <p>This graphical component primarily serves as a tool for testing the editor’s functionality. However, dynamic
            language modification plays a crucial role in making the editor generic and usable for other types of devices.
            Adjustments are necessary during the editor startup and language modification according to the device model(s)
            for which the program will be created. Unit commands and parameters offered during program creation are derived
            from the model.</p>

        <h4>Input Validation</h4>
        <p>The editor must handle the validity of user input. In the text editor, this involves syntactic analysis of the
            text input, which is parsed into an object representation of the program. Syntax errors are indicated as shown
            in the figure below:</p>
        <div class="img-center">
            <img src="../img/syntaxErrorHighlight.png" alt="Syntax Error Highlight">
        </div>

        <p>Since the project's main goal was visual programming, less emphasis was placed on text code validation. On the
            other hand, the visual editor includes support for semantic validation through static analysis of the program’s
            object model. An example, such as an incorrectly placed <span class="texttt">else</span> command that should follow an
            <span class="texttt">if</span> command, is shown in the figure below:</p>
        <div class="img-center">
            <img src="../img/semanticErrorExample.png" alt="Semantic Error Example">
        </div>

        <p>These conditions are defined within the structural properties of the commands.</p>

        <h4>Scalability</h4>
        <p>The editor is scalable. Individual parts of the editor (text and visual sections, menu, or menu buttons) can be
            shown or hidden both manually and programmatically. This feature is particularly useful for mobile views, where
            only limited width is available. An example of the mobile view is shown in the figure below:</p>
        <div class="img-center">
            <img src="../img/mobileView.png" alt="Mobile View">
        </div>

        <h3>Try It Out!</h3>
        Bellow you are able to try out both editors. Note that it might be better to visit them directly, especially if you
        are on mobile.
